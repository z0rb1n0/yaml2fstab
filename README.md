yaml2fstab

A tool to decode a yaml file defining designated mounts and generate a fstab file


The project is a single script, so its design rationale is documented in the
initial docstring of the main callable [yaml2fstab.py](yaml2fstab.py)


The script itself uses argparse too, so inline --help is available
